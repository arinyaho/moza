"""Render the mien identity segment for a Claude Code status line.

The segment answers one question, always in view: *who am I acting as here* —
and turns red the moment the answer is wrong. An agent session that inherited
one identity from the shell it was launched in, sitting in a directory that
belongs to a different identity, is exactly how a personal commit lands in a
work repository. The status line makes that visible before it happens.

The rendering is pure and secret-free by construction: it takes only two profile
*names* (never a token) and formats them, so it is safe to call at status-line
frequency.
